The CSS specificity rules can be confusing and lead to unexpected behavior. For example, if you have two rules that target the same element, the rule with higher specificity will win. Specificity is determined by a combination of factors, including the number of IDs, classes, and elements in the selector. Sometimes, this can lead to unintended consequences where a style is overridden without the developer realizing it.
